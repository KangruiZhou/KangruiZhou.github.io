#### Introduction
For centuries, physicists and mathematicians have pursued the elegant simplicity of symbolic equations to describe complex phenomena—from Newton's laws of motion to Maxwell's electromagnetic field equations. Yet when confronting ​​multiscale systems​ or ​​nonlinear dynamics​ (e.g. neuroscience, climate science, and financial markets), traditional derivation methods encounter an exponential explosion in the hypothesis space. The combinatorial complexity of potential governing equations renders brute-force symbolic search computationally prohibitive.

The advent of data-driven discovery offers a paradigm shift. Machine learning (ML) techniques seem to be a powerful tool to uncover underlying physical laws or governing equations from sparse/noisy observations. So, how can we use machine learning to accelerate model discovery in the science?

In this [repo](https://github.com/KangruiZhou/SRpapers), I list some representative work on SR and give some personal comment. Let's collectively decode the algorithms accelerating scientific discovery!

Any corrections and suggestions are welcomed.
