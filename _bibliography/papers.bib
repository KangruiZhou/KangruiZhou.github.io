  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Rapid thermal stress analysis is crucial for the thermal design of satellites. To overcome the disadvantages of traditional algorithms in terms of efficiency, deep learning methods have been used to tackle these problems. However, using uniform grid-based techniques is challenging when faced with complex geometric shapes. To address this, we introduce the domain decomposition-based Hybrid Fourier Neural Operator (HFNO), a comprehensive framework for learning a multi-scale and end-to-end operator on two-dimensional point clouds. We then propose two decomposition metrics: a stress gradient-based metric for scenarios with prior knowledge of training data, and a mesh density-based metric for scenarios without prior knowledge. Leveraging K-Dimension tree-based domain decomposition optimized via Monte Carlo tree search, we decompose the computational domain into several disjoint rectangular subdomains. In the proposed hybrid framework, a Geometry-aware Fourier Neural Operator (Geo-FNO) is used to deal with subdomains with high-frequency information, while a Non-Uniform Fourier Neural Operator (NU-FNO) is used to deal with subdomains with low-frequency information. This framework effectively combines the advantages of two Fourier Neural Operator variants, overcoming the issue of large prediction errors on the subdomains with high-frequency information and ensuring stable prediction performance across different positions. Furthermore, we introduce a boundary loss term during the training process to enhance continuity across subdomain boundaries. The numerical results demonstrate that our method achieves a superior balance between efficiency and precision, surpassing that of a single algorithm.},

abstract = {Occlusions pose a significant challenge to depth estimation in various fields, including automatic driving, remote sensing observation, and video surveillance. In this Letter, we propose a novel, to the best of our knowledge, depth estimation method for dense occlusion to estimate the depth behind occlusions. We design a comprehensive procedure using an event camera that consists of two steps: rough estimation and precise estimation. In the rough estimation, we reconstruct two segments of the event stream to remove occlusions and subsequently employ a binocular intersection measurement to estimate the rough depth. In the precise estimation, we propose a criterion that the maximum total length of edges of reconstructed images corresponds to the actual depth and search for the precise depth around the rough depth. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is implemented with relative errors of depth estimation below 1.05\%.},
